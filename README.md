Final Project - Angry Dragons 

Program Description: 
This program is a game called Angry Dragons, which is based on the game Angry Birds but includes a Game of Thrones twist. The goal of the game is to
kill all of the guards that you encounter in each level, in order to take over a city. In order to win, you have to conquer all of the cities on the map. when you 
start each level, you begin with a certain amount of dragons at your disposal. In order to kill the guards, you have to launch the dragons at them using the 
slingshot on the left of the screen. Once you kill all the guards, you will conquer that city and be allowed to move on to the next level.
